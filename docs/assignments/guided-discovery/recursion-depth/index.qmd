title: "Guided Discovery: Recursion and Performance"
---

Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems, but it can also have important drawbacks. In this Guided Discovery activity, you'll implement a simple recursive function for the Fibonacci numbers. You'll then practice some techniques for measuring the performance of functions in terms of how long it takes them execute.
