<p>CSCI 0145, Introduction to Computing, is an introductory course in computer science at Middlebury College. It is one of several ways in which you might begin a computer science major at Midd. It’s also a great way for you to develop your computational skills to support other majors.</p>
<p>The primary aim of CSCI 0145 is to help you build strong foundations in computational thinking and programming skills. We will cover a fair amount of the Python programming language. That said, our primary focus will be on reasoning, program design, and implementation principles rather than the details of Python programming.</p>
<p>Learning computing for the first time can be a challenging experience. In a nutshell, my teaching philosophy is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your wellbeing as a human person is more important than any grades.</li>
<li>It is my job to help you learn and grow, as a computer scientist, scholar, and public citizen.</li>
<li>You can count on me to do my job to the best of my ability.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>A learning objective is a primary goal for your learning by the end of the course. You’re successful in CSCI 0145 when you achieve excellence against these learning objectives. We have six learning objectives in CSCI 0145.</p>

<p>This course has 4 hours of class time per week. My expectation is that most students will spend <strong>6-10 additional hours</strong> outside of class on assignments, readings, tutoring sessions, and review.</p>
<p>If you find yourself needing to spend much more than 8 hours to keep up with the course, please let me know. It may be that other approaches or ways of using support resources can help.</p>

<p>Weights for computing your final grade in CSCI 0145.</p>
</div></div><ul>
<li><strong>Learning behavior incentives</strong> include participation and the reading quizzes. Their purpose is to promote behavior that supports the learning of you and your peers.</li>
<li><strong>Formative assessments</strong> include labs and homework. Their primary purpose is to give you regular practice that will help you meet the course learning objectives. They also give you an opportunity to get <em>feedback</em> on your strengths and opportunities for improvement</li>
<li><strong>Summative assessments</strong> include our midterm and final exam. Their primary purpose is to give an overall measurement of your cumulative learning throughout the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might look at these three different purposes and say:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Hey Phil, isn’t it weird to combine points from three totally different purposes into a single grade?”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>If you did, I would say: yes, it is! More generally, <strong>grading is broken</strong>. This is especially true of summative assessments. Instructors struggle to design assessments that equitably measure meaningful competency, and the results are rarely predictive of future success. </p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">Professor Amy J.

<p>If you have followed lecture on Monday and Wednesday and learned from the required reading, then you are ready for the week’s reading quiz. You might find it useful to review the posted lecture notes in order to prepare for the reading quiz.</p>
<p>Reading quizzes are automated through Canvas. In most cases, the quiz will have a time limit and you’ll be permitted one attempt.

<h1>Course Resources</h1>
<section id="books" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="books">Books</h2>
<p>There are no required books to purchase in this course. Required and optional readings will come from free online sources, especially including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html">How to Think like a Computer Scientist</a>: an interactive book with many embedded activities.</li>
<li><a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//fopp/index.html#">Foundation of Python programming</a>: another interactive book with a fair amount of overlapping with “How to think like a Computer Scientist”</li>
<li><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">ThinkPython</a>: please note that despite providing a good introduction to Python, the language and examples used in this book are not the most inclusive. Most of the examples are drawn from the comedy routines of the British surrealist comedians “Monty Python (Links to an external site.)” which, to someone who has never seen any of their material, will not be particularly helpful.</li>
<li><a href="https://avaccari.gitlab.io/csci-0145/sp22/index.html">Course notes</a>: together with other members of the CS Department, we are putting together our own interactive notes for the intro courses. This is still a work in progress and they are constantly edited so, go back often to check since there might be new goodies appearing over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/">Python 3.7 Documentation</a>: This is the official documentation for the Python programming language. Following along with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/index.html">Tutorial</a> is an excellent way to develop your skills, and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/index.html">Language Reference</a> is also extremely helpful. Note that this is the documentation for Python 3.7, rather than the most current Python 3.10. This is because Python 3.7 is the version that comes bundled with Thonny, and is therefore the version we will use in this class. The differences between 3.7 and 3.10 are minimal and unlikely to ever come up in CSCI 0145.</li>
</ul>

<section id="python-thonny" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="python-thonny">Python: Thonny</h2>
<p>We’ll write most of our Python code in Thonny. Thonny is a simple integrated development environment (IDE): a place to write, run, and troubleshoot code. It can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux. Please see the <a href="https://thonny.org">Thonny website</a> for installation instructions. Thonny comes bundled with Python version 3.7, which is the version that we will use throughout CSCI 0145.</p>

While you are welcome to use your IDE of choice on your own time, <strong>we expect you to use Thonny</strong> during class time and when working with partners on labs. This is to ensure that we don’t have to spend precious group time with one partner getting used to another partner’s IDE.</p>

<section id="collaborative-python-replit" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collaborative-python-replit">Collaborative Python: replit</h2>
<p>We’ll have regular group assignments that will ask you to collaborate on coding projects. In general, the expectation is that only one person will be coding at a time. However, in order to ensure that you don’t need to do things like swap laptops when it comes time to change roles, we’ll complete these assignments in an online collaborative coding environment called <a href="https://replit.com">replit</a>. You’ll sign up for our CSCI 0145 team on replit using an invite link posted in Canvas. You’ll then be able to work with partners on guided discovery and lab assignments in the replit interface. It’s a bit more complex than Thonny, but has the same core functionality.</p>

<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<section id="laptops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="laptops">Laptops</h3>
<p>You are expected to bring a laptop computer to most class sessions. If you ever find yourself temporarily in need of a laptop, the Computer Science department has 10 rotating Dell laptops available to our students. These come pre-installed with software for most of the courses in the major. They are available to be loaned out short-term or long-term based on your need (as determined by you). To request a laptop for <strong>short-term use</strong> (like a single class period), email me ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>On Long-Term Use</strong>: College policy has changed recently to include the expectation that every student have a laptop available. The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. However, our department commits to meeting the needs of every student, so do not be afraid to reach out if you believe you need one of our laptops for any length of time.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="help">Asking For Help</h3>
<p>First of all, <strong>ask for help often</strong>. Asking for help is a fundamental part of how you will learn in CSCI 0145. Here is some wisdom on this topic from the Best Cat On the Internet:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-class">In Class</h4>
<p><strong>In lecture</strong>, please ask questions freely. Just raise your hand and I’ll find a good place to pause for you.</p>
<p><strong>On activity days</strong>, start by asking your group members. If you’re all stuck, then go ahead and raise your hand for a tutor or me. We’ll be right with you!</p>
</section>
<section id="outside-class" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outside-class">Outside Class</h4>
<p>For questions on Campuswire, in tutoring, and in Student Hours, our expectations are that you will <strong>prepare to ask for help</strong>. This has two purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The very process of preparation will help you learn. You might even find that in the course of the preparation process you were actually able to resolve your question.</li>
<li>When you’re prepared, our conversations can be efficient and productive.</li>
</ol>
<p>When asking questions to me or the tutors, you should usually expect us to start with a question of our own:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What have you tried so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question has two functions. First, it helps me understand where you are and how I can most effectively help you. Second, it reminds you to take steps to support your own independent learning prior to approaching me. Here are the steps that I expect you to follow in some of the most common cases:</p>
<p><strong>For conceptual questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a reasonable effort to review relevant readings ahead of time.</li>
<li>Formulate your question in as precise and specific a way as you are able.</li>
<li>If applicable, find an example that illustrates your question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For programming questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formulate the task you are attempting to accomplish as precisely and specifically as possible.</li>
<li>Write down a few concepts, functions, data structures, or other ideas that seem like they might be relevant in this problem.</li>
<li>Get as far as you can on the problem using the tools available to you. Make sure you can carefully describe what you did and why it seems like progress toward the goal.</li>
<li>Be prepared to explain approaches what you have already tried when speaking with me or a tutor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you are debugging and encountering an error message</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Read your error message</em></strong> and do your best to understand what it means.</li>
<li>If you’re not sure how to interpret your error message in the context of your task, try Googling the message and reading some of the resulting answers.</li>
<li>If you’re still stuck, try to construct a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> or <em>reprex</em>. Sometimes, just the activity of creating a reprex will help you solve your problem. However, if you’ve created your reprex and you’re still stuck…</li>
<li>Bring your error message and reprex to tutoring or to Student Hours, or post it on Campuswire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are debugging and not encountering an error message</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make use of Thonny’s debugger to step through your program.</li>
<li>Identify the first point at which something is clearly wrong.</li>
<li>Develop at least one hypothesis about the source of the error, and test that hypothesis.</li>
<li>If you’re still stuck, try to construct a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> or <em>reprex</em>. Sometimes, just the activity of creating a reprex will help you solve your problem. However, if you’ve created your reprex and you’re still stuck…</li>
<li>Bring your reprex to tutoring or Student Hours, or post it on Campuswire. Make sure to clearly state both the <em>expected behavior</em> and the <em>actual behavior</em> of your program.</li>

<section id="due-date-adjustments" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="due-date-adjustments">Due Date Adjustments</h3>
<p>In general, late work is not accepted in this course. However, <strong>you can request adjustments to due dates</strong>. To do so, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/pmF7mtA637uXpUs77">this form</a>. You’ll be asked to tell me about the assignment, your current due date, and your proposed modified due date. You’ll also be asked to briefly reflect on what you need from yourself (and from me) to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>Policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I almost always grant requests received <strong>at least 24 hours ahead of the original due date.</strong> Be prepared for the possibility that I will adjust your due date, but with a smaller adjustment than you originally requested. In this case, I’ll notify you.</li>
<li>Requests received <strong>within 24 hours of the original due date</strong> are subject to my discretion.</li>
<li>I almost always deny requests received <strong>after the original due date</strong>. I may offer a chance to turn in the assignment with a penalty.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I’m not offended when your work comes in late, provided that it doesn’t become a problem for our graders (who, like you, are students here!). However, please make sure that you plan your time and prevent your work from piling up. I don’t really have any way to help you if you have too much to do at the end of the semester after requesting many due date adjustments.</p>

<section id="collaboration-policy-and-the-honor-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collaboration-policy-and-the-honor-code">Collaboration Policy and the Honor Code</h3>
<p>Please take a moment to review our general <a href="./collaboration.html">guidelines and principles</a> on collaboration. This document also includes how I think about group work, academic dishonesty, and related topics.</p>
<p>Specifics for this course:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group activities</strong> (labs and guided discovery activities) should be entirely the work of you and your partner(s), without help from other groups. The group can submit a single file representing everyone’s work. In the case of labs, you’ll be asked to write a short group contribution statement describing who made which contributions to the submitted product.</li>
<li><strong>Quizzes</strong> should be completed by you, without consulting any other human beings for help. You are welcome to use any written or online resources you can find (the course readings will usually be the most useful).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Homework exercises</strong> should be completed by you. You are welcome to collaborate with other students, but <strong>do not share solution code.</strong> That is, you may discuss strategies and approaches, but not code details. You are permitted to share solution code with the tutors. You can share <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible examples</a> with anyone, in-person or on Campuswire. You are also free to use any written or online resources you can find. Whenever you get help from or collaborate with a person, or whenever you use a resource not presented in class, <strong>you must acknowledge this help and describe how it contributed to your submitted work</strong>. For example, if you got the idea for a short code block from a StackExchange post, indicate this in a comment above the block. You should acknowledge all help from humans you received, including classmates, tutors, and myself.</li>
<li><strong>Exams</strong> should be completed by you, with no resources other than those specified by the exam conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re ever unsure about how the Honor Code applies to a specific situation or what kinds of collaboration is permitted in this course, please just ask!</p>
