<p>CSCI 0145, Introduction to Computing, is an introductory course in computer science at Middlebury College. It is one of several ways in which you might begin a computer science major at Midd. It’s also a great way for you to develop your computational skills to support other majors.</p>
<section id="learning-objectives" class="level1">
<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>A learning objective is a primary goal for your learning by the end of the course. You’re successful in CSCI 0145 when you achieve excellence against these learning objectives. We have six learning objectives in CSCI 0145.</p>

<p>Reading quizzes are automated through Canvas. In most cases, the quiz will have a time limit and you’ll be permitted one attempt. Generally, the time limit is intended to be much longer than is required to complete the quiz. In a few exceptional quizzes, there may be no time limit or there may be multiple attempts.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labs">Labs</h3>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Lab assignments are small projects that synthesize concepts and programming techniques from recent lectures. There is a lab almost every week.

<section id="x-lab-details" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="x-lab-details">:x Lab Details</h4>
<p>In the first week, we’ll do labs individually. After that, we’ll do labs in <strong>pairs</strong> that rotate every two weeks. Labs are therefore always about our <span class="learning-objective"> programming</span> and <span class="learning-objective">design/collaboration</span> learning objectives. Many labs will also raise reflection questions related to <span class="learning-objective">social responsibility</span> in the context of <span class="learning-objective">applications</span> of computing.</p>
<p>Friday’s scheduled lecture period is time for you to begin the assignment with your partner. Most labs are intended to require more than a single lecture period. You and your partner should find time later in the week to complete the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>I recommend that you plan to meet during one or more tutoring sessions!</strong></p>
<p>I expect most labs to require approximately 3-4 hours in total to complete – one in class and two or three outside of class.</p>

<section id="homework-exercises" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homework-exercises">Homework Exercises</h3>
<p>Homework assignments give you practice writing code to solve relatively simple problems. They primarily help you make progress against our <span class="learning-objective">programming</span> and <span class="learning-objective">computational thinking</span> learning objectives. Some homework problems will also ask you to write <span class="learning-objective">analysis</span> of simple programs or to <span class="learning-objective">apply</span> your skills to solve complex problems. There’s a homework due most weeks. I expect homework assignments to require, on average, 3-4 hours in total to complete.</p>
<p>You are welcome to collaborate on homeworks, but <strong>you should not share code</strong> with your classmates. It’s great to talk over strategies and concepts with anyone you like – just make sure you give them credit according to our <a href="./collaboration.html">collaboration policies</a>. You have great resources to help you on homeworks, including:</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself temporarily in need of a laptop, the Computer Science department has 10 rotating Dell laptops available to our students. These come pre-installed with software for most of the courses in the major. They are available to be loaned out short-term or long-term based on your need (as determined by you). To request a laptop for <strong>short-term use</strong> (like a single class period), email me ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>On Long-Term Use</strong>: College policy has changed recently to include the expectation that every student have a laptop available. The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. However, our department commits to meeting the needs of every student, so do not be afraid to reach out if you believe you need one of our laptops for any length of time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are <em>still</em> in a pandemic. My assumption is that there will be positive COVID tests on campus, and that some of them may occur in our class. If you are feeling ill or test positive for COVID:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Do not attend class in person</strong>. Isolate per College <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/covid-19-updates/middlebury-college-main-campus/campus-guide/essential-health-and-safety-measures-8">policies</a>. We have relatively detailed lecture notes and other resources that will help you catch up with lecture content.</li>

<section id="due-date-adjustments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="due-date-adjustments">Due Date Adjustments</h3>
<p>In general, late work is not accepted in this course. However, <strong>you can request adjustments to due dates</strong>. To do so, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/pmF7mtA637uXpUs77">this form</a>. I usually grant adjustment requests of up to 3 days, provided that they are submitted before the deadline. I consider larger adjustments on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind both your needs and the needs of our student graders.</p>
<p><a href="#x-due-date-adjustment-details">:Details</a></p>
<section id="x-due-date-adjustment-details" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="x-due-date-adjustment-details">:x Due Date Adjustment Details</h4>
<p>You’ll be asked to tell me about the assignment, your current due date, and your proposed modified due date. You’ll also be asked to briefly reflect on what you need from yourself (and from me) to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>Policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I almost always grant adjustments of up to 3 days for requests received <strong>at least 24 hours ahead of the original due date.</strong> Be prepared for the possibility that I will adjust your due date, but with a smaller adjustment than you originally requested. In this case, I’ll notify you.</li>
<li>Requests received <strong>within 24 hours of the original due date</strong> are subject to my discretion.</li>
<li>I almost always deny requests received <strong>after the original due date</strong>. I may offer a chance to turn in the assignment with a penalty.</li>
</ul>

<!-- In general, I'm not offended when your work comes in late, provided that it doesn't become a problem for our graders (who, like you, are students here!). However, please make sure that you plan your time and prevent your work from piling up. I don't really have any way to help you if you have too much to do at the end of the semester after requesting many due date adjustments.  -->

<p>This course has 4 hours of class time per week. My expectation is that most students will spend <strong>6-10 additional hours</strong> outside of class on assignments, readings, tutoring sessions, and review.</p>
<p>If you find yourself needing to spend much more than 10 hours outside class to keep up with the course, please let me know. It may be that other approaches or ways of using support resources can help.</p>
<section id="collaboration-policy-and-the-honor-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collaboration-policy-and-the-honor-code">Collaboration Policy and the Honor Code</h3>
<p>Please take a moment to review our general <a href="./collaboration.html">guidelines and principles</a> on collaboration. This document also includes how I think about group work, academic integrity, and related topics.</p>
<p>Specifics for this course:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group activities</strong> (labs and guided discovery activities) should be entirely the work of you and your partner(s), without help from other groups. The group can submit a single file representing everyone’s work. In the case of labs, you’ll be asked to write a short group contribution statement describing who made which contributions to the submitted product.</li>
<li><strong>Quizzes</strong> should be completed by you, without consulting any other human beings for help. You are welcome to use any written or online resources you can find (the course readings will usually be the most useful).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Homework exercises</strong> should be completed by you. You are welcome to collaborate with other students, but <strong>do not share solution code.</strong> That is, you may discuss strategies and approaches, but not code details. You are permitted to share solution code with the tutors. You can share <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible examples</a> with anyone, in-person or on Campuswire. You are also free to use any written or online resources you can find. Whenever you get help from or collaborate with a person, or whenever you use a resource not presented in class, <strong>you must acknowledge this help and describe how it contributed to your submitted work</strong>. For example, if you got the idea for a short code block from a StackExchange post, indicate this in a comment above the block. You should acknowledge all help from humans you received, including classmates, tutors, and myself.</li>
<li><strong>Exams</strong> should be completed by you, with no resources other than those specified by the exam conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re ever unsure about how the Honor Code applies to a specific situation or what kinds of collaboration is permitted in this course, please just ask!</p>
