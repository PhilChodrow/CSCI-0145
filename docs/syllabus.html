<h1 class="unnumbered">Syllabus</h1>
<p>CSCI 0145, “Introduction to Computing,” is an introductory course in computer science at Middlebury College. It is one of several ways in which you might begin a computer science major at Midd. It’s also a great way for you to develop your computational skills to support other majors.</p>
<p>The primary aim of CSCI 0145 is to help you build strong foundations in computational thinking and programming skills. We will cover a fair amount of the Python programming language. That said, our primary focus will be on reasoning, program design, and implementation principles rather than the details of Python programming.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-objectives" class="level1">
<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>A learning objective is a primary goal for your learning by the end of the course. You’re successful in CSCI 0145 when you achieve excellence against these learning objectives. We have six learning objectives in CSCI 0145.</p>

<p>This course has 4 hours of class time. My expectation is that students will spend, on average, <strong>8 additional hours</strong> outside of class on assignments, readings, tutoring sessions, and review.</p>
<p>If you find yourself needing to spend much more than 8 hours to keep up with the course, please let me know. It may be that other approaches or ways of using support resources can help.</p>

<p>Weights for computing your final grade in CSCI 0145.</p>
</div></div><ul>
<li><strong>Learning behavior incentives</strong> include participation and the reading quizzes. Their purpose is to promote behavior that supports the learning of you and your peers.</li>
<li><strong>Formative assessments</strong> include labs and homework. Their primary purpose is to give you regular practice that will help you meet the course learning objectives. They also give you an opportunity to get <em>feedback</em> on your strengths and opportunities for improvement</li>
<li><strong>Summative assessments</strong> include our midterm and final exam. Their primary purpose is to give an overall measurement of your cumulative learning throughout the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might look at these three different purposes and say:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Hey Phil, isn’t it weird to combine points from three totally different purposes into a single grade?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you did, I would say: yes, it is! More generally, <strong>grading is broken</strong>. This is especially true of summative assessments. Instructors struggle to design assessments that equitably measure meaningful competency, and the results are rarely predictive of future success. Professor Amy J. Ko at the University of Washington has a <a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/grading-is-ineffective-harmful-and-unjust-lets-stop-doing-it-52d2ef8ffc47">reflection</a> on the deep flaws of grading, which you might wish to read.</p>
<p>The grading system for this course is not perfect! My promise to you is that I will be as transparent as I can about how I assess you, where you can improve, and how you can achieve your goals in the course.</p>

<p>If you have followed lecture on Monday and Wednesday and learned from the required reading, then you are ready for the week’s reading quiz. You might find it useful to review the posted lecture notes in order to prepare for the reading quiz.</p>
<p>Reading quizzes are automated through Canvas. In most cases, the quiz will have a time limit and you’ll be permitted one attempt. Generally, the time limit is intended to be much longer than is required to complete the quiz. In a few exceptional quizzes, there may be no time limit or there may be multiple attempts.</p>

<p>Friday’s scheduled lecture period is time for you to begin the assignment with your partner. Most labs are intended to require more than a single lecture period. You and your partner should find time later in the week to complete the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>I recommend that you plan to meet during one or more tutoring sessions!</strong></p>
<p>I expect most labs to require approximately three hours in total to complete – one in class and two outside.</p>

<h1>Course Resources</h1>
<section id="books" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="books">Books</h2>
<p>There are no required books to purchase in this course. Required and optional readings will come from free online sources, especially including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html">How to Think like a Computer Scientist</a>: an interactive book with many embedded activities.</li>
<li><a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//fopp/index.html#">Foundation of Python programming</a>: another interactive book with a fair amount of overlapping with “How to think like a Computer Scientist”</li>
<li><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">ThinkPython</a>: please note that despite providing a good introduction to Python, the language and examples used in this book are not the most inclusive. Most of the examples are drawn from the comedy routines of the British surrealist comedians “Monty Python (Links to an external site.)” which, to someone who has never seen any of their material, will not be particularly helpful.</li>
<li><a href="https://avaccari.gitlab.io/csci-0145/sp22/index.html">Course notes</a>: together with other members of the CS Department, we are putting together our own interactive notes for the intro courses. This is still a work in progress and they are constantly edited so, go back often to check since there might be new goodies appearing over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/">Python 3.7 Documentation</a>: This is the official documentation for the Python programming language. Following along with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/index.html">Tutorial</a> is an excellent way to develop your skills, and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/index.html">Language Reference</a> is also extremely helpful. Note that this is the documentation for Python 3.7, rather than the most current Python 3.10. This is because Python 3.7 is the version that comes bundled with Thonny, and is therefore the version we will use in this class. The differences between 3.7 and 3.10 are minimal and unlikely to ever come up in CSCI 0145.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="python-thonny" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="python-thonny">Python: Thonny</h2>
<p>We’ll write most of our Python code in Thonny. Thonny is a simple integrated development environment (IDE): a place to write, run, and troubleshoot code. It can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux. Please see the <a href="https://thonny.org">Thonny website</a> for installation instructions. Thonny comes bundled with Python version 3.7, which is the version that we will use throughout CSCI 0145.</p>

<p>The Thonny IDE.</p>
</div></div><p>You may already be familiar with a different IDE, and may prefer it to Thonny. While you are welcome to use your IDE of choice on your own time, <strong>we expect you to use Thonny</strong> during class time and when working with partners on labs. This is to ensure that we don’t have to spend precious group time with one partner getting used to another partner’s IDE.</p>

<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<section id="laptops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="laptops">Laptops</h3>
<p>You are expected to bring a laptop computer to most class sessions. If you ever find yourself temporarily in need of a laptop, the Computer Science department has 10 rotating Dell laptops available to our students. These come pre-installed with software for most of the courses in the major. They are available to be loaned out short-term or long-term based on your need (as determined by you). To request a laptop for <strong>short-term use</strong> (like a single class period), email me ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>On Long-Term Use</strong>: College policy has changed recently to include the expectation that every student have a laptop available. The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. However, our department commits to meeting the needs of every student, so do not be afraid to reach out if you believe you need one of our laptops for any length of time.</p>

<section id="missing-class" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="missing-class">Missing Class</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we are <em>still</em> in a pandemic. My assumption is that there will be positive COVID tests on campus, and that some of them may occur in our class. If you are feeling ill or test positive for COVID:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Do not attend class in person</strong>. Isolate per College <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/covid-19-updates/middlebury-college-main-campus/campus-guide/essential-health-and-safety-measures-8">policies</a>.</li>
<li><strong>When you are feeling up to it</strong>, contact me about how to make up work for the course.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most lectures will be recorded. I’ll share the recordings with students who contact me to ensure that everyone has a chance to learn from lecture. I’ll create opportunities for you to make up graded in-class assignments on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</section>
<section id="help" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="help">Asking For Help</h3>
<p>Both I and your tutors like talking with you about the course content. Here’s what you can do in order to make our conversations efficient and productive.</p>
<p>When asking me a question, you should usually expect me to start with a question of my own:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What have you tried so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question has two functions. First, it helps me understand where you are and how I can most effectively help you. Second, it reminds you to take steps to support your own independent learning prior to approaching me. Here are the steps that I expect you to follow in some of the most common cases:</p>
<p><strong>For conceptual questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a reasonable effort to review relevant readings ahead of time.</li>
<li>Formulate your question in as precise and specific a way as you are able.</li>
<li>If applicable, find an example that illustrates your question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For programming questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formulate the task you are attempting to accomplish as precisely and specifically as possible.</li>
<li>Write down a few concepts, functions, data structures, or other ideas that seem like they might be relevant in this problem.</li>
<li>Get as far as you can on the problem using the tools available to you. Make sure you can carefully describe what you did and why it seems like progress toward the goal.</li>
<li>Be prepared to explain approaches what you have already tried when speaking with me or a tutor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are debugging and encountering an error message</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Read your error message</em></strong> and do your best to understand what it means.</li>
<li>If you’re not sure how to interpret your error message in the context of your task, try Googling the message and reading some of the resulting answers.</li>
<li>If you’re still stuck, try to construct a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> or <em>reprex</em>. Sometimes, just the activity of creating a reprex will help you solve your problem. However, if you’ve created your reprex and you’re still stuck…</li>
<li>Bring your error message and reprex to tutoring or to Student Hours, or post it on Campuswire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are debugging and not encountering an error message</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make use of Thonny’s debugger to step through your program.</li>
<li>Identify the first point at which something is clearly wrong.</li>
<li>Develop at least one hypothesis about the source of the error, and test that hypothesis.</li>
<li>If you’re still stuck, try to construct a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> or <em>reprex</em>. Sometimes, just the activity of creating a reprex will help you solve your problem. However, if you’ve created your reprex and you’re still stuck…</li>
<li>Bring your reprex to tutoring or Student Hours, or post it on Campuswire. Make sure to clearly state both the <em>expected behavior</em> and the <em>actual behavior</em> of your program.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="due-date-adjustments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="due-date-adjustments">Due Date Adjustments</h3>
<p>In general, late work is not accepted in this course. However, <strong>you can request adjustments to due dates</strong>. To do so, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/pmF7mtA637uXpUs77">this form</a>. You’ll be asked to tell me about the assignment, your current due date, and your proposed modified due date. You’ll also be asked to briefly reflect on what you need from yourself (and from me) to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>Policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I almost always grant requests received <strong>at least 24 hours ahead of the original due date.</strong></li>
<li>Requests received <strong>within 24 hours of the original due date</strong> are subject to my discretion.</li>
<li>I almost always deny requests received <strong>after the original due date</strong>. I may offer a chance to turn in the assignment with a penalty.</li>

<section id="advice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="advice">Advice</h4>
<p>I am always happy to talk with you about your future plans, including internships, research opportunities, and graduate school applications. Because I am a creature of the academy, I am less knowledgeable about industry jobs, although you are welcome to ask about those too.</p>
</section>
<section id="letters-of-recommendation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="letters-of-recommendation">Letters of Recommendation</h4>
<p>If you have completed a course with me or are currently enrolled, you are welcome to request a letter from me. If I feel that I am not able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you – but if you still want a letter from me, I will still write it.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or office hours. If you’d like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To request a letter, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/tL79wtFrfHC5Vspw7">this request form</a>! Please give me at least one month of advance notice when possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="when-i-wont-write-a-letter" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-i-wont-write-a-letter">When I Won’t Write a Letter</h4>
<p>As a matter of moral principle, I will not write letters of recommendation for programs or jobs involving any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policing (including but not limited to predictive policing, development of algorithms that predict recidivism, etc.);</li>
<li>Military applications (such as internships at the Department of Defense or any of its international counterparts);</li>
<li>Weapons manufacturing, broadly construed;</li>
<li>Intelligence gathering (such as internships at the NSA, FBI, or any international counterpart).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very happy to discuss this policy with any student who has questions. Conversations about when and how mathematics, data science, and programming should be used are lacking in our community. If you’d like to engage me in such a conversation, that would be great! However, this policy is non-negotiable. Therefore, if I refuse to write you a letter on these grounds, please know that it doesn’t reflect on your ability to succeed in this course, your career potential, your worth as a person, or whether I like you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/">Just Mathematics Collective</a> has compiled a list of resources for students on making ethical career decisions, which is available <a href="https://justmathematicscollective.net/career_resources.html">here</a>. The text of this section is lightly modified from their <a href="https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/letter_writing.html">suggested text</a> on letter-writing.</p>
