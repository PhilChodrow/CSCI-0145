ACTIVITY 1
----------

Examine your Results report. Did any of your results surprise you? Did your choices reflect any preferences you didn't expect, such as preferences related to gender, age, fitness, or social value? Write 3 sentences describing how they feel about their report and place them below. 

[At least 3 sentences on your Results report]
